# Noneq-asym-PCI-private

In this repository you can find the code that was used for the results in 'Nonequilibrium dynamics elicited as the origin of perturbative complexity'. 
Some functions are not available with Scipy versions older than v1.13.1

## Data
- gEC_W.npy and gEC_n3.npy
  - the generative effective connectivity matrices for the sleep dataset (n = 18, W = wakefulness, N3 = deep sleep)
  - The Sleep data set is publicly available at https://github.com/yonisanzperl/Perturbation_in_dynamical_models

## Functions
- fun_hopf.py
  - Simulates a timeseries using the Hopf model, including a perturbation by adjusting the bifurcation parameter for the nodes that you want to stimulate.
